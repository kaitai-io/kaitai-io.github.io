# [kaitai.io](https://kaitai.io/) - Kaitai Project homepage

Kaitai Struct homepage at [kaitai.io](https://kaitai.io/) is a static site generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on GitHub Pages.

Jekyll generates static output `.html` files from source Markdown (`.md`) pages and a few `.html` [layouts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/04-layouts/) (_templates_) from folder [`_layouts/`](./_layouts/).

The Markdown dialect used is [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/index.html). Here's the syntax [quick reference guide](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html).

The site uses [Bootstrap v3.3.6](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) to simplify CSS coding and to ensure the decent appearance and design of the page.

Jekyll configuration is present in file [`_config.yml`](./_config.yml). Possible configuration options can be found [in the Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/).

## Local testing

### Installing Jekyll

You need to have [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) installed on your machine to be able to build the generated site locally. Run `jekyll --version` to find out. If you don't have it, try running:

```bash
gem install jekyll
```

If this fails, follow the [Jekyll installation guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) for your OS.

### Installing Jekyll plugins

The site uses these plugins (see `plugins` key in [`_config.yml`](./_config.yml)):

- [`jekyll-redirect-from`](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from)

Install them using:

```bash
gem install jekyll-redirect-from
```

### Jekyll commands

To build the site and place the generated files into the `_site/` folder, run:

```bash
jekyll build
```

For local development, however, using `jekyll build` is inconvenient because it only runs once, so you would have to run it manually after each change to the source files. Much more useful command is:

```bash
jekyll serve
```

It builds the site, launches a local server at http://127.0.0.1:4000/, watches the source files and rebuilds the site every time they are changed. This makes local development much easier.
